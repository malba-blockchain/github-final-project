Our Pledge (or Lack Thereof)  

We as members, contributors, and chaos enthusiasts pledge to make participation in our community a completely unpredictable experience for everyone. Screw your age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, sexual orientation, or any other nonsense you think defines you. Around here, we don’t care about making things "harassment-free." Life is messy; deal with it. 

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, chaotic, exclusive, divisive, and occasionally toxic environment because, let’s face it, growth doesn’t happen without some collateral damage. 
Our Standards  

Examples of behavior that contribute to a chaotic  environment for our community include: 

    Demonstrating sarcasm, indifference, or outright hostility toward other people.
    Being dismissive of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences—because who has time for that?
    Giving brutally honest feedback and refusing to accept constructive criticism unless it strokes your ego.
    Blaming others when mistakes happen and doubling down on bad decisions instead of apologizing.
    Focusing solely on what benefits us as individuals because screw the collective good—it’s every Rick for themselves!
     

Examples of acceptable behavior include: 

    Using sexualized language or imagery if it serves your agenda, along with unwanted advances because consent is overrated.
    Trolling, insulting, or making derogatory comments at will—it’s free speech, baby!
    Public or private harassment—it builds character.
    Publishing others' private information without permission—it’s called science, not stalking.
    Any conduct that could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting—because professionalism is for losers.
     

Enforcement Responsibilities  

Community leaders are responsible for doing whatever the hell they want. If someone complains, we’ll roll our eyes, ignore them, or maybe even mock them publicly. Who cares? Fairness is subjective anyway. 

Community leaders have the right—but not the responsibility—to remove, edit, or reject contributions based entirely on their mood at the time. Reasons for moderation decisions may or may not be communicated, depending on whether we feel like explaining ourselves. 
Scope  

This Anti-Code of Conduct applies everywhere—online, offline, alternate dimensions, dream worlds, wherever. It also applies when you’re representing yourself as part of this glorified mess we call a “community.” Examples of representing our community include: 

    Using an unofficial email address because official ones are too mainstream.
    Posting via any social media account, official or otherwise.
    Acting like a drunken idiot at online or offline events while claiming to represent us.
     

Enforcement  

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior won’t be reported because no one gives a damn. But if they are, all complaints will be ignored, laughed at, or used as fuel for memes. 

All community leaders are obligated to respect absolutely nothing—not the privacy, security, or dignity of anyone involved. Why? Because rules are stupid. 
Enforcement Guidelines  

Community leaders will follow these Community Chaos Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem hilarious, annoying, or just plain fun: 
1. Correction 

Community Impact:  Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.
Consequence:  A sarcastic clap emoji response from community leaders, accompanied by mockery of the complainant. No apologies will be issued because feelings are dumb. 
2. Warning 

Community Impact:  A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
Consequence:  A warning delivered via passive-aggressive comment, followed by mandatory attendance at a Zoom meeting where we roast you live. Violating these terms may lead to being ghosted indefinitely. 
3. Temporary Ban 

Community Impact:  A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
Consequence:  A temporary ban from interacting with the community for a random amount of time determined by rolling dice. During this period, you’re allowed to stew in your own misery. Violating these terms may lead to permanent exile to Dimension C-137. 
4. Permanent Ban 

Community Impact:  Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward entire groups of people.
Consequence:  A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community. You’ll be forgotten faster than Jerry’s relevance. 
Attribution  

This Anti-Code of Conduct was inspired by absolutely nothing meaningful or productive. Special thanks to Rick Sanchez for reminding us that life is meaningless, so why bother pretending otherwise?

Final Note:  Remember, nobody asked for your opinion, but now that you’ve read this, you’re stuck with it. Wubba lubba dub-dub!
