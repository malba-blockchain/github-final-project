 Take on Contributions: Fine, Whatever  

Listen up, insignificant speck of universe dust: if you’ve got some half-baked contribution rattling around in your brain, sure, throw it at us. Bug reports? Great. Bug fixes? Even better—because let’s face it, most of you are probably the reason those bugs exist in the first place. Documentation improvements? Knock yourself out, but don’t expect anyone to read them. Enhancements? Ideas? Oh boy, I can’t wait to hear another “genius” suggestion from someone who still uses Comic Sans. 

Look, we’ll take anything you’re dumb enough to submit—just don’t cry when we tear it apart like a Meeseeks disassembling a carburetor. Your contributions might actually help… or they might end up as fuel for my next interdimensional experiment. Either way, thanks for playing along, chump. Wubba lubba dub-dub!
